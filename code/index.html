              <p> It was a normal afternoon in the small town Froskeby when the dangerous speeding incident had the locals raising eyebrows. The driver claims someone must have glued his foot to the gas pedal. The police are now investigating who might have done this. </p>
              <p> Snail mother of four: - "I don't believe a word the driver is saying! I didn't see any foot or any glue! He could have killed our children or crushed our house!" </p>
              <p> A witness claims to have seen a shady hedgehog in the area right before the incident. If you have seen a hedgehog, please contact the police.</p>
