# News Site

First assignment for Technigo's Web developer bootcamp. The task was to create a newspaper or magazine site with a header containing a logo and navbar, a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. The page should be responsive. 

## The problem

I started off without knowing where to start or on which parts of the site to use Flexbox and/or Grid. The first few days was really just about facing a lot of problems and trying to solve them by looking at other people's web sites. I came to the conclusion that it was best to not copy any code straight off, since I didn't know what the person/people behind the sites that I was looking on had been thinking when they designed their page/s/, plus when looking at fellow peers' projects I didn't know if their solutions was 'correct'. I then changed strategy to go back to basics and work on one part of the page at the time and remove unnecessary code that I'd added when trying to fix previous problems but that didn't really add anything at all to the site. 
I had much help looking at instruction videos + Codepens from Technigo, searching for answers on Stack Overflow, search on Google, in Slack conversations with our class and I got A LOT of help using the inspector tool, both in Chrome and Firefox simultaneusly as in VS Code. I was ticking and unticking the checkboxes to see what happened, added/removed code to see shat happened before actually changing the code in VS Code, clicked on the different parts of the design to see what element it belonged to etc. when looking for errors. 
I'm very happy that I had two screens to work on. That also helped a lot. 

If I had more time, I would change make all the cards clickable and and spend more time on the design. 

Next time I do something similar to this project I will definitely build the site step by step, starting with sketch, then create a 'HTML Skeleton' and last CSS.
